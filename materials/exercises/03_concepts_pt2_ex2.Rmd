# Exercise 2


## Data import

```{r preparation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```

***Don't know where to start?*** In the folder `img/3-2-circular-lollipop` you'll find step-by-step charts.

## Circular Lollipop

-   Create a circular lollipop plot of reported bike shares per season.
    -   The data is not in the right format as there are no totals.<br>How can you solve it?
    -   Remove all legend elements (with a single line of code).
    -   How can you add the labels next to the starting point of each lollipop?
    -   How could you add a baseline?

```{r plot}
ggplot(bikes, aes(y = fct_infreq(season), x = count, fill= season))+
  geom_col()+
  coord_polar(theta = "y")

ggplot(
    bikes,
    aes(x = fct_infreq(season),
        fill = season)
  ) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y")
```

```{r i-am-done-what-now, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/exercise-what-now-sd.png")
```
