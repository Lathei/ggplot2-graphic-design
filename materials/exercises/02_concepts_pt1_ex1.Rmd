Notes

## Data import

```{r preparation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

bikes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3tt/graphic-design-ggplot2/main/data/london-bikes-custom.csv", 
  col_types = "Dcfffilllddddc"
)

bikes$season <- fct_inorder(bikes$season)

bikes
```



    Create a scatter plot of temp_feel vs temp.
        Map the color of the points to clear weather.
        Map the size of the points to count.
        Turn the points into diamonds.
        Bonus: What do you notice in the legend? How could you fix it?

```{r}
ggplot(bikes, aes(x=temp_feel, y=temp))+
  geom_point(aes(fill=weather_type == "clear",
                 size = count),
                 shape = 23,   # makes a triangle 
                 color="black",
                 alpha = .5)




```

```{r}
ggplot(
    bikes,
    aes(x = temp_feel, y = count,
        color = season,
        group = day_night)
  ) +
  geom_point(
    alpha = .5
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm",
    color = "black"
  )
```


## Timeseries of reported bike shares on weekend days


```{r plot}
ggplot(bikes %>% filter(is_weekend==T), aes(x=date, y=count,
                 color = day_night))+
  geom_point(aes(shape = day_night),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_line() +
  theme_linedraw()+
  labs(
    title = "bike rentals compared night and day 2015 to 2017",
    tag = "vis 1"
  )
```

  
  
  
  
```{r i-am-done-what-now, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/exercise-what-now-sd.png")
